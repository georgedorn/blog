Plagues are a traditional plot element in many fantasy settings.  Some of the earliest D&D modules include plagues or diseases as plot devices or motivators.  Yet at the same time, many of these settings include divine magic, with the ability to cure diseases of all sorts.

How can we resolve this discrepancy?  How can there be plagues *and* cheap, effective anti-disease magic?

1. Magic Resistance
-------------------

A common answer in published modules; the princess is sick and the adventurers need to obtain the magic flower of the macguffin plant to cure her.  What's that?  The party cleric can just cast *cure disease*?  The party paladin can just lay on hands?  Well, er, um, the disease is resistant to your magic!

We can extend this logic to create plagues that can't simply be stopped by a small force of clerics.

But this answer has always felt like a cop-out to me.  Why have a spell like *cure disease* if it never works?  So the DM has to remember to create situations where the spell *can* work; enemies cast *cause disease* to be annoying, curing the sick in a town might ingratiate the party to the locals, etc.  It's a lot of work just to keep a spell around.

2. Not Enough Clerics
---------------------

A simple solution for a low-magic campaign.  This works best if you establish that clerics are a special breed of adventuring clergy who get spells while ordinary preachers and acolytes do not.

This works less well in settings like BECMI's Greyhawk, where it's established that almost all major NPCs and local leaders have significant class levels.  How can a plague strike Threshold, when the leader there is a 12th level Cleric and much of his extended family can cast *cure disease* as well?

3. Hyperactive Plague
---------------------

Perhaps you have sufficient clerics to stop your average Black Death in its tracks.  What about a plague that is so contagious, recipients of *cure disease* get no immunity against contracting it a second time?  Clerics can cure some people, but anybody cured would have to go into hiding to avoid re-catching it immediately.

Coupled with high lethality, this option yields a powerful, epic-level threat.  In nature, diseases that are extremely fatal and extremely contagious tend to be self-defeating, running out of hosts too fast to spread over great distances. Villages are destroyed very quickly, possibly whole cities, but then the contagion burns itself out.  This makes for a compelling narrative about settlements becoming ghost towns overnight, but doesn't leave a lot of room for adventurers to do anything about it as it happens.
