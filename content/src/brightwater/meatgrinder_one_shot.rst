Over the weekend, I hosted a one-shot kickoff funnel game.
I used the module `Meatgrinder <https://backtothedungeon.blogspot.com/2016/04/a-new-free-0-level-funnel-to-1st-level.html>`_, a free zine-style adventure for Dungeon Crawl Classics.

Funnels and DCC Occupations
---------------------------

A *funnel* is a module for many low-level characters, often level 0 commoners, in which most die or are grievously wounded, but the survivors become adventurers.
Despite being a relatively recent invention, a funnel module provides several helpful features for starting OSR games. They're the opposite of modern D&D;
PCs are nearly powerless, believable people with ordinary lives.  Funnels set the tone of danger and desperation of low-level adventuring and are story
generators, creating backstories for heroes in-game.  Combined with a simple character generation system, funnels can be as low-friction as starting a boardgame,
except heroes emerge from the other side.

I'm borrowing a handful of ideas from DCC for this system as well.  Most notable are occupations instead of skills.  Every commoner has a job of some sort,
providing just enough information to know what the character might be good at.
While the DCC backgrounds include things like guards, soldiers and demihumans, I cobbled together a new collection from several giant lists of medieval occupations without military or combat-competent jobs.
Meatgrinder kills off the King's Army and town militia in the opening scene, leaving only a small band of irregulars, the PCs.

Character Generation
--------------------

I streamlined the process of creating a character, pre-rolling 30 characters and filling out custom index-card character sheets.  Ability scores were simply 3d6, in order, and space was left for name, occupation/background, AC, Hit Points and notes.  Occupations were charted up roughly on a d200 table, with each associated with one or two ability scores.

Character creation was relatively fast:
- draw a PC card
- name the PC (a list of suitable names cribbed from Dungeon World was provided, but players preferred making their own silliness)
- roll on the big occupation chart, rerolling if the ability scores were an outright awful match, or if unrealistic duplicates happened (how many professional egg candlers can a small frontier town support?)
- come up with a tool or implement related to that occupation that, in a pinch, the PC could fight with.  DCC provides these but I left it wide open for players to invent their own.

Finally, I gave the option to age the character, giving them a roll every 5 years to become better at their jobs.  The roll was a simple d20, rolling under a related stat (and alternating every 5 years).
"Levelling up" in a job had no concrete game effects, but I did provide a new title (often Journeyman or Master) and some ideas about what getting better at the job meant.
I also used critical successes (rolling very low) to sprinkle in some folk magic; one character had a brooch they believed kept wild animals away while they
collected medicinal herbs in the woods, and another (the "dog leech" or town veterinarian) learned a song that seemed to calm distressed animals.

All-told, 10 players created 20 characters in about a half hour. There was room to front-load even more of this; I had plans to create occupation cards,
each with three occupations to pick from (and their stats), along with concrete tool/weapon suggestions and leveling up options.  I still plan to develop this,
but ran into issues with my laser printer.  Another six characters joined the party after being rescued (replacing other fallen PCs) and that only took a minute
or two while other players were planning their next steps.

Actual Play
-----------

The players are a band of irregulars told to hold a mountain pass outside of town against invading beastmen. I had the players select somebody to carry
the absent Duke's backup war banner (which quickly became a spear). Fires brought the PCs back to town, where they found much of it burnt down.
The stone church where the villagers too young, old or infirm were hiding had been breeched and a bonfire in the town commons had "a couple dozen" horrible
beastmen cooking and eating people. Meatgrinder goes _hard_ on the child-murder, but I toned it down, deciding that beastmen stole children to raise as
more beastmen.

The first fight began with a _lot_ of careful planning. For obvious reasons, the players were tentative about a frontal assault, so they picked three
volunteer runners to harrass them and try to draw them into a fight.  After two rounds of hilariously bad attempts to throw stones at the beastmen, six decided to give chase.
With slightly fewer beastmen to deal with, the irregulars relunctantly charged.  The opening barrage was barely effective, reducing the beastmen in number
to match the PCs, so I had the players roll attacks for beastmen against their own characters.  It was brutal, with every hit scored killing or maiming a PC.  A second round of battle went only slightly better, but I decided to check morale, realized morale wasn't a provided stat for the beastmen, and decided they weren't in the mood to lose more of their number, what with their leader having left them behind for cleanup duty.
The beastmen withdrew, giving the PCs a minor victory and setting the stage for surviving NPCs to tell the story of what happened.

The three runners rolled CON to see how fast they could run, outpacing half of their pursuers.  Two PCs ran to the tanning pits and dove in (ick), and the last ran to the woods with two pursuers.  They caught up with him, but one fumbled his attack badly, throwing a meat cleaver into the other's head.
Some desperate wrestling later had the PC (the village tinker) smashing in the skull of the beastman, the first truly heroic moment.

The survivors regrouped at "the old old mine", where an NPC told the players about the attack: the small band of King's Army soldiers
sent to defend the town (and lead by the local duke) were routed at the river (with cries of "dragon!", though no survivor witnessed a dragon) 
and the militia fell to the beastmen.  The leader of the beastmen, a 10-foot-tall boar-headed man, ordered the town burned, the survivors slaughtered,
and then took the children and marched south along the river.

The PCs considered ransacking the Duke's Manor, but decided against treason (too bad, given the handful of useful weapons and armor they'd have found there).
Weapons from the fallen beastmen and one unburned King's Army soldier were gathered, mostly crude meat cleavers but one shortsword and a suit of banded mail
(I ruled that it would fit best on PCs with physical stats closest to the dead soldier).

Eventually, the players worked up the courage to go after the beastmen, trailing them to their lair in The Mountain Pass Caves (of Doom!).  They sent scouts
up the stone steps to the cave mouth, beginning the actual dungeon crawl proper after two hours into the session.  They scouted the first room, full of
bedbug-ridden cots and furs, waffled at the next tunnel and after their eyes adjusted to the darkness realized the tunnel contained some beastmen.

Too much planning later, the PCs assembled into cot-weilding pairs and lured the beastmen into the first room.  Befitting the pathetic aesthetic, the cot-weilders
had marginal success barricading or pinning the beastmen, but this was enough to kill the first two without casualties.  Five more approached, but the scouts
had discovered a drainage area in middle of the tunnel and suspected a pit trap, and sure enough the beastmen had to cross along the edges in single-file.
Three more were dispatched before the rest began to flee; slowed by avoiding the pit trap, they fell to numerous thrown spears and a miner's pickaxe.

The tunnel lead to a room lit by firelight, with two side tunnels.  These were briefly investigated; one had treasure on a pedestal (surrounded by eerie gem-eyed stone faces) and the other had some terrifying wall of spikey gears, so the party continued into the dining hall.

They charged into the dining hall, where the feasting beastmen were surprised. Only a couple fell, with hilarious fumbles on both sides, but aften a second
round of fighting the four remaining beastmen fled further into the caves.  The dining hall contained a pen with ten or so villagers waiting to be eaten;
six were able-bodied enough to join the irregulars, replenishing some of their ranks and picking up weapons from the fallen.

While the party regrouped and carried their casualties to the cave mouth, one PC decided the gold on the pedestal was too enticing and decided to climb up to collect it.  He died from the poison gas before he could finish saying "hey, something smells weird".  The tinker also spent some time
studying the terrifying spiked gear wall from a distance, realizing it might move around the room it was in and deciding it was too terrifying to approach.

This left with one avenue; a narrow tunnel in the back of the dining room leading into the darkness.  Two scouts investigated tentatively, finding a pale blue glow at the other end.  Eventually they worked up the courage to find its source, a pyramid-shaped room with a single chanting beastmen in robes working a ritual sacrifice of a villager.
The scouts tried distracting the beastman summoner, who only sped up the ritual, sliced open the sacrifice and called some chaos demon. The cultist fell
fairly quickly, but the demon started emerging from the chest of the sacrificed villager.  Many attempts to wrestle the body off
the crude stone altar were made, but the demon latched on with thin, boney tentacle-fingers (I was imagining The Thing at the time) until somebody thought to
throw the night watchman's lantern on the corpse to set it on fire.  With the gateway into this realm on fire and the summoner dead, the demon opted to retreat.

At this point, it was four hours into the session and I decided to add more tunnels to make getting to the final fight easier.  The players were also focused
on finding the children, so the two tunnels out of the summoning room were inspected and one (back into the meatgrinder room) was clearly dusty, so the other
was followed.  The simplicity of the dungeon was a benefit here, along with listening for what the players wanted.

The more-used tunnel lead to a room with a dragon (!).  A dragon!  The PCs were rightly terrified, but the dragon seemed largely disinterested in them.  This
scene was mostly for comic effect (what color dragon is it?  it's dragon-colored!  how did it fit in here?  maybe they raised it from an egg?) but finally
one player got the idea to feed it the cultist and I decided the dragon-shaped pig would be content with that.  I had the pig carry the cultist to one corner,
leaving two tunnels to choose from - one next to the dragon and one not, so they chose to stay far from the dragon.

That tunnel lead to the Pigman's room, where the children of the village were formed in a circle around him, staring blankly. There was room here to find
out what was going on, but the players were having none of that; they charged in with everything they had left.  One PC did decide to drag some kids out,
but the rest surrounded the Pigman, who started goring and hewing PCs while they poked and prodded him with sharp implements. He finally fell to a blow
from a heavy staff (I think a pole from the BBQ pit?). It would have been an anticlimactic fight but for the viscious followup blows the players narrated
"to make sure he's dead."

The PCs then escorted the wounded, the children, and carried the dead back to town, stopping only briefly to use some jury-rigged ropes and poles to pull the gold off the pedestal without being close enough to the gas to die from it.


Notes on Running the Game
-------------------------

Morale rolls didn't work, at all. I suspect in a more typical dungeon crawl, where reaction rolls are also used, the pair might be relied on to make combat
avoidable or end quickly, but in this scenario reaction rolls didn't make sense and I had to overrule the morale rolls constantly, having the beastmen flee at the first sign the PCs might be a threat,
to keep the game moving and to avoid a full TPK.  The feeling of desperation was unharmed by this; a majority of PCs fell in battle, some killed outright and
others permanently maimed.

Another missing mechanic was the option for the PCs to flee.  The players never considered running, aside from the impromptu
chase scene near the start of the session, simply because running might mean their children died.
In future sessions, where the goal is a little less immediately pressing, I'll need to telegraph unwinnable fights more

Initiative was very free-form.  I was going to have each side roll once, but then I realized I could gain some of the benefits of individual initiative,
even with ten players, by rolling once for the monsters.  The combatants ended up in three groups - those that beat the monsters, those that tied the monsters (and thus went simultaneously) and those that lost initiative
(or had giant two-handed weapons, like the farmer with the scythe).  Each group went in any order,
though by the end of the night I just picked one side of the table at random and went around.


What Now?
---------

From here I hope that a group or two will form from the players wanting to continue the story.

With 2/3rds of the town dead, the Duke missing, and harvest season just starting, the PCs now must decide how to 
spend the gold they found to best survive the upcoming winter and rebuild the town.  They've also witnessed real magic, real horrible eldritch magic,
magic traps, demon summoning, and pigs somehow transformed into dragons.  There's some more of the cave system to investigate and clues to other
adventuring locales to find.

Not to mention becoming level 1 characters.
