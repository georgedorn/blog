While working on some homebrew rules for my low-magic Rules Cyclopedia game, I stumbled over my own incorrect assumption that BECMI handed out treasure almost as often as 3.5.  This made me realize that a more careful analysis is needed, and that the analysis could make adjusting published materials for other additions easier.  I've frequently used Basic, 1e and 2e adventures in my long-running 3.5 game, with the minor side effect of not distributing quite as much magical treasure as 3.5 expects.

"When do you get how much treasure?" is a tough question, so I'm going to break this analysis down into a few key categories:

#. **Consumables vs upgrades**: in any given treasure hoard, what portion of the treasure is potions, wands, scrolls, etc, vs permanent magical weapons, armor, and stat upgrade equipment?  This may vary by level; up until 3.5e, treasure was determined by treasure type, with different monsters having different treasure distributions.
#. **Expected rate of aquisition**:  At what level should we start seeing +1 swords?  Rings of protection +1?  Plate mail +4?  While the plusses won't match exactly from edition to edition (a +5 sword is far more powerful in BECMI than 3.5e, for example), I can at least examine the major milestones.
#. **A trip to the mall**: How does buying/selling magic items work in the edition, and what can we expect a typical PC to obtain given their expected level of wealth?

Consumables vs Upgrades
-----------------------

Basic (B/X, BECMI, Rules Cyclopedia)
====================================

There are 15 Group Treasure Types and 7 Individual Treasure Types in Red Box Basic.  These drastically change the expected types of coins, gems and jewelry found in any given treasure, but it's only the Magic Items column that matters to us.

Entries that are "Any X" end up using the Magic Item Type table:

.. image:: basic_magic_item_type.jpg

From this, we see 40% weapons and armor, 5% rings and 5% miscellaneous.  Rods also tend to be permanent, but "Other Weapons" also includes consumable ammunition for missile devices and thrown weapons.  Also, the extra treasure types that exclude weapons and armor or add more potions, scrolls, etc make up for it.  I'm comfortable with this approximation: **in Red Book Basic, roughly 50% of treasure is a consumable**.

Expert doesn't change the distribution of types, but does add unguarded treasure, which is always a percentile chance of "any 1" magic item.

Companion doesn't change the treasure types, but does rearrange the Magic Item Type table:

.. image:: companion_magic_item_type.jpg

This table increases the odds of Miscellaneous items, and separates Missle or Device from where it was previously included in "Other Weapons".  The odds of a consumable are still roughly 50%, however, as some new miscellaneous items are consumable.

Master adds artifacts, but doesn't really change magic item distribution anyway.

AD&D First Edition
==================

First edition doesn't mention Treasure Types in the DMG, saving it for the appendix of the Monster Manual, where the number of types increased to 26.  But unlike Basic, we get hint to the design intent of treasure distribution that doesn't depend on what type of monster you fight.

The Treasure (Random Determination) chapter is supposed to be about treasure maps and the hoards they lead to, but I am guessing a lot of DMs ended up using to populate random treasure hoards.

.. image:: first_edition_magic_treasure.jpg

The paragraph that follows it suggests this does reflect design intent:

  This random determination table needs no explanation. Because of its weighting, and the weighting of the MAGIC ITEMS table, most treasures will have magic potions, scrolls, armor and weapons. This is carefully planned so as to prevent imbalance in the game. Keep potent magic items rare. (Increase scarcity by destroying or stealing what is found!)

As for the distribution using this table (and the Magic Items Type table), **if we generate 100 magic items, we get roughly 25 permanent items like swords, armor, rings, and 75 consumables like potions, scrolls, wands.**

The actual balance will depend heavily on monster type, of course, but in the Monster Manual Treasure Types appendix, it is clear that potions and scrolls are emphasized moreso than in Basic.

AD&D Second Edition
===================

Second edition simplified the Treasure Type table slightly, making it a little easier to estimate results.  The vast majority of magic items found in lairs have no restriction on type, while individual treasure leans a bit more towards consumables.  

For unrestricted ("Any") types, about 40% will be a consumable (potions, scrolls, staves, wands, and a small portion of miscellaneous items).  Even with individual monsters carrying potions and scrolls (treasure types S, T and X), it's clear there's a shift in focus from consumables to permanent upgrades.

D&D 3.5
=======

3.5e did away with treasure types entirely. Awarding treasure now depended on the level of the encounter, with some monsters adjusting the results (e.g. some monsters having 50% more gems, or half as many coins).  The treasure chart results in mundane, minor, medium, and major items being awarded.  Medium items start to appear at level 6, major items appear at 10th (and become increasingly likely at higher levels).

.. image:: third_edition_magic_items.jpg

From this we see that the portion of consumable items is quite high (70%) for minor items and drops off rapidly for medium (48%) and major (20-25%) items.  Minor items continue to appear, though less commonly, so as PCs gain levels and fight more difficult foes, they can expect to find an increasing proportion of permanent upgrade items.

In addition, there's clear intent given in a sidebar, which presents a table explaining how much income and wealth a party should expect at any given level.

.. image:: third_edition_wealth.jpg

Working back from this, it would appear that the designers expected PCs to spend about 75% of their income on expenses - being raised from the dead, having spells cast, consuming purchaseable items, etc.


D&D Fourth Edition
==================

Fourth edition finishes divorcing treasure from monsters, suggesting instead that the DM simply award treasure from a table of Parcels.  For example, a level 1 party could find:

.. image:: fourth_edition_treasure_parcels.jpg

With the exception of specifically-listed potions, magic items found in treasure parcels are all permanent.  Even wands, which don't have charges.  This is because almost all expendable resources are part of the character, not separate equipment, with the notable exceptions of potions, gold, and residuum (raw magic item dust, used for making more magic items).

Additionally, some intent about consumables is included:

  Keep an eye on how many potions you give the characters. Donâ€™t give out more than about three to five potions over the course of a level. 

So we can see that permanent items are the vast majority of magic item treasure.  Magic is more of a character configuration choice, which is why this was the first edition to put magic items into the Player's Handbook.

D&D Fifth Edition
=================

Fifth backed away from gear-as-configuration and returned to a system closer to third.  Treasure hoards are sized according to challenge level, with one table for every five levels (corresponding to tiers).  There are also 8 Magic Item subtables, A through I, and as challenge rating increases, higher-lettered subtables are used more frequently.

.. image:: fifth_edition_magic_item_table_a.jpg

Potions an scrolls make up the vast majority of types A through E.  F through I are all permanent or semi-permanent, as wands and staves now regenerate charges and only destroy themselves rarely when reduced to their last charge.

On almost all tier tables, the odds of getting a consumable-heavy subchart is about 75%.  And even then, the table generally awards 1d6 entries from the consumable table, and 1d4 or just 1 entry from the permanent items tables.  Between the two effects, that's roughly 4 consumable items for every permanent item found, the highest ratio to date.  But this, too, fits with the fifth edition design ideal of a much shallower power curve; armor, shields and weapons have a maximum bonus of +3.

Expected rate of aquisition
---------------------------

When do we start seeing +1 swords and +1 armor?  When do permanent missile devices (not ammunition) start showing up?  And when can we expect to find game-changing magic devices like bags of holding, rings of wishes, vorpal swords and the like?  Though the definition of game-changing depends on the edition, there are definitely certain items in each that drastically change the feel of the game, and obtaining such items is like crossing a threshold to a different kind of adventure.

Basic (B/X, BECMI, Rules Cyclopedia)
====================================

BECMI suggests using just the Red Book rules for levels 1-3, then switching to Expert. Expert replaces the magic subtables from Basic, adding higher-level magic but retaining the lower-level still.  This makes finding particularly powerful items a matter of luck, not balance; it's possible for a level 1 fighter to join a level 4 party, and pick up a Sword +3 from a Bandit lair.  It's unlikely (less than 0.3%), however.

More realistically, level 1 PCs aren't going to be attacking full lairs of monsters.  Since individual monsters rarely carry treasure, it's not until the party has gained a few levels that they'll be confident enough to go after a treasure hoard likely to contain significant numbers of magic items.

This is reflected in the B series of adventures, and we can use the chart on page 6 of B1-9 In Search of Adventure to find a rough idea of an appropriate order of adventures.

.. image:: B_series.jpg


- B9 - Castle Caldwell - has a sword +1, +2 vs undead in the hands of a berserker and a dagger +1 inside a gelatinous cube.
- B9 also includes Elwyn's Sanctuary as another possible starting point; that dungeon in uniquely a spiral, forcing the party to encounter everything in order, which means every treasure is guarded by every monster before it.  The first sword +1 is extremely well-hidden and comes after a golem, who cannot be hit by non-magical weapons!  The final encounter is Elwyn, who has a shield +1 and a mace of draining +1, which is far more dangerous in her hands than the party's.
- B2 (Caves of Chaos) has assorted +1 items in posession of NPCs within the keep, and in the adventure proper are an assortment of +1 items (daggers, shields, hand axes, ring of protection) in the hands of major enemies, and a suit of plate mail +1 in the treasure hoard of a minotaur (quite dangerous at level 1).  Similarly, a 3rd-level evil priest has +1 plate mail and a +1 shield, and a wight is guarding a sword +2.  Obtaining these more powerful items should be exceptionally difficult for a typical party of levels 1-3.  The wight in particular is likely to level drain at least one PC, probably more.

Basic edition adventures seem to have followed a design pattern of allowing up to +2 items, but generally only one or two per adventure and always well-guarded, well-hidden, or far out of the normal adventure path.  This trend continues in Expert:

- X1 - Isle of Dread (levels 4-10) has a few higher-level items, including chain mail +3 that requires random chance to find, an evil priest has a mace +2, and a sword +2 is the reward for a difficult bit of spelunking in an active volcano guarded by powerful lizardmen.
- X6 - Quagmire (level 5-8) has some prerolled characters of 6-9th level, which gives us an idea of what the designer thought was balanced.  Each has generally one, maybe two +1 items, with an exception of a war hammer +2.  The module also has some traveling magic item merchants, but only 3% of their items are not fake and they charge a huge amount for them.  The main magic items in the adventure are *spears of returning* which have no to-hit or damage bonus, just return to your hand when you miss.

So even up through Expert, a +1 sword is a luxury worth fighting for (or to keep).  As for *wishes*, they could appear as early as level 1, but the chances are vanishingly small (even lower than the sword +3 example).

In short, Basic attempted to ensure that magic was a rare, well-guarded or hard-to-find reward for particularly brave or daring adventurers.


AD&D First Edition
==================

First edition has two sections on treasure distribution.

Appending P: Creating a Party includes rules on creating higher-level PCs. On the subject of magic items:

  If the party is assumed to have been adventuring for some time, however brief, then it is probable that one or more of their number would have acquired certain magic items. In order to reflect this likelihood, use the following tables for the various classes of adventurers, as applicable to your group:
