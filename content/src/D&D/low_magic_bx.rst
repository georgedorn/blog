I'm putting together a homebrew version of Basic (BECMI and/or B/X) for when our group finishes the nearly-epic-level 3.5 campaign that we've been playing for years.  A lot of high-level 3.5 play is dissatisfying to me, and one of the many issues is the proliferation of magic items, particularly boring, flavor-less items.

The issue came to light as the PCs were captured by mindflayers and stripped of their gear, slowly regaining it as they stalked the illithid sept, ambushing some mindflayers and making deals with others.  I asked each player to provide the list of items they had, along with marking five items that were most important to them.  I used the list to equip the many mindflayers and their allies, but the important items were split between the obvious powerful items and those with emotional weight.

The epitome of the problem is the rogue's *Gloves of Dexterity +4*; it's a generic stat bonus, it's universally applicable, and despite being a +4 I don't think anybody can remember where they came from.

Contrast that with an item she was awarded at the end of the Red Hand of Doom story arc - `Sniper Goggles <http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/e-g/goggles-sniper-goggles>`_ backported from Pathfinder (with adjustments for balance).  Despite being useful only in certain circumstances (or perhaps **because** of), they have flavor, they're very important to the PC, and she remembers where they came from.

With this in mind, I'm developing some concepts to apply to the next campaign.

1. More Consumables
-------------------

Simply removing most magic items from the game will hurt game balance, badly.  In 3.5, a 12th-level fighter who hasn't maxed out every equipment slot with a magical item is far less powerful than one who has.

Some of this gap can be rectified by adding more and better consumables, especially consumables gifted by NPCs or created by the PCs to tackle a particular obstacle.  Potions, scrolls, wands and consumable wondrous items should make up at least 75% of low-level magic items found in treasure hoards.

2. More Hedge Wizardry
----------------------

Most towns have witches, hedge wizards and devout religious practitioners.  Most can't cast a 1st-level spell, instead relying on a handful of extremely limited cantrips (more *prestidigitation* than *ray of frost*) and ritual  magic.  In dire circumstances, they can work together to bless adventurers, brew potions, create magic trinkets, etc.

When trolls emerge from the mines and start raiding a town, the hedge wizards of the town pick some heroes to aid with their limited magic. Working overnight, they create a few *potions of fire weapon*.  When applied to melee weapons or missiles, a single hit from the weapon is treated as fire damage, thus negating a troll's regeneration.

3. More low-level magic
-----------------------

Long before you find a simple +1 longsword, you find oils of accuracy, swords blessed only against kobolds, herb poultices noxious to ogres, eye-seeking sling bullets, etc.  Items that are only useful in certain situations.  Items with significant drawbacks.  Consumables to get you through one hard fight.

4. Permanent Items Have Personality
-----------------------------------

No *gloves of dexterity +4*.  If an item is permanent and useful in most situations, it needs to have history.  It needs to be memorable.  It needs to glow blue in the presence of orcs, or refuse to harm intelligent beings.  A *longsword +2 vs dragons* is far better than a *longsword +1, +3 vs dragons*.  A sword that gains a +1 to damage for an hour after being fed fey blood, or mundane armor that can be used by a thief (but only for an hour after treatment with an expensive exotic oil...)

Any weapon with greater than +2 should have some additional effects, drawbacks, quirks and personality.

5. More Artifacts
-----------------

Inscrutable, unreliable, with agendas of their own, artifacts provide far more plot than generic items.  Yet PCs rarely touch them; why bother using the potentially-dangerous intelligent *Sword of Kas* when you can rely on your *+4 longsword*?  With high-powered, universally-useful magic items missing from the game, there's far more room for artifacts of all levels of power.


Balance Issues in Basic / Expert
--------------------------------

I'm coming off a long-running 3.5 game, so my focus has been on its flaws.  Ripping out most magic items from 3.5e would cause all sorts of balance problems.  However, B/X cares a lot less about balance than 3.5.  The DM is not expected to ensure that every encounter has a CR somewhere around the party's level.  If there's a dragon in that cave, it's the players' responsibility to decide if that encounter is a winnable fight, a useful parley, an opportunity for the thief, or best avoided entirely.

Basic (levels 1-3) barely require magic items at all.

Expert starts to require some magic items, but it still grants far fewer than 3.5, at least in published modules.  Some examples:

- X1: Isle of Dread (3-7) contains a smattering of +1 weapons, some cursed items, a *ring of regeneration*, a difficult-to-reach set of *chain mail +3* (found in the underwater lair of a sea hydra), a *mace +2*, a well-hidden *sword +2 (with charm person)* and *ring of telekinesis*
- X6: Quagmire (4-10) barely contains any non-consumable magic.  There's some traveling magic merchants who mainly have fakes, a handful of *returning spears* with no hit/damage bonus, and the pregenerated characters have a +1 or +2 weapon at most, no magical armor, and a *single ring of protection +1*.
- X8: Drums on Fire Mountain (5-8) is slightly more generous; defeating the Big Bad grants two permanent items (armors +2), an *amulet of protection +3* and another encounter could yield a *shield +1*, a *sword +1, +3 vs regenerating monsters* and a *dagger +2*.

It's not until around Master (11+) than significant magic items are expected.  At this point, items with personality can fill in for *chain mail +4*, up until artifacts start to make sense.
